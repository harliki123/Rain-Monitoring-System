# Rain-Monitoring-System
This project implements a Rain Monitoring System using an Arduino microcontroller. The system is designed to detect the intensity of rain and provide corresponding outputs through digital and PWM signals. It is ideal for applications such as weather stations, automated irrigation systems, and smart home integrations.
